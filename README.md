# Gannit (Organizing Files CLI App)

This is my first Go project, a CLI app for organizing files. When you run the command, it will reorganize all images, music, and documents to "Music", "Images", and "Documents" folders in the same directory. If the folders don't exist, they will be created.

## Installation

To install the app, clone the repo and build the binary:
```
git clone https://github.com/m66are/gannit.git
```
```
cd gannit
```
```
go build -o gannit
```

This will create an executable binary called `Gannit`. You can then run the app using the following command:

```
./gannit
```

## GUI Version

In the future, I plan to add a GUI version of the app with shortcuts and other cool features. Stay tuned!

## Disclaimer
This app is still in development and is not ready for production use. Use at your own risk.
